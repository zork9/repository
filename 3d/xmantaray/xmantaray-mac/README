XRayManta + PonyParser : A Raytracer research framework
_______________________________________________________

Try to program games in 2D and 3D and keep them open source
software for all kids in the world!

2D games: 
_________
There are xpm image interfaces with which you can make a 2D game.
The 3D models together with xpm files can be used for hybrid 2D-3D.

3D games:
_________
HACKING NOTE : Try toe override the draw( method of RayManta.cc for 3D
projects. See the HACKING file.

There are pthread and fork versions (main.fork.cc and main.pthread.cc) but 
they do not work yet in usual X.
The Matrix3/Vector3 and Matrix/Vector classes can be used to make markov 
processing for forked raycasting, a markov process evaluates which
line to draw first in the framework (See RayMantaNet.cc - 
function markovpropagate.)
There is a function generate matrix for Boltzman-statistical time-series
multi-core propagation (You have to put the RayMantaNet::fork() functions 
inside the RayMantaNetMarkov2 propagator.)

You can search the propagator of the Markov process with a Genetic Algorithm
which will search for the correct solution in decision space i.e.
The GA will converge where drawing points becomes the full raycast/raytraced
object (int this code a sphere.) There is GA code in RayMantaGA.h/.cc .
A GA can also be used to calculate the fittest Markov projection/time-series
matrix.

By using 3D engine code one can easily discern upcoming 3D objects with this
multi-core raytracer.

The framework can also use a GA instead of Boltzmann matrices (See RayMantaGA.h/.cc)
