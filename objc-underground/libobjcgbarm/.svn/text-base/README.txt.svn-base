This is a small pure C subcompilation system for objC on the GameBoy Advance
ARM and other ARM processors. Memory of objects gets managed in libmemory
(seperate XCode project that gets included in libobjcgbarm.)
The compiler is a seperate executable in a separate XCode project.

The suite was made for Intel Macs.

Enjoy & Love
