This is libcarm a small utility lib for ARM processors
. Adapt the makefile to build the library for BSD/Mac/Linux/...

. You can build a boostrappable file (objcopy command of arm-eabi-*) with libcarm inside the elf objcopy data file using the libojcgbarm conmpiler system 


NOTES:
. GBA has a Ram and Screen buffer
. This project is just files compilable with gcc (C,objC) and is built inside
the libobjcgbarm/ project files.
. small kernel files for ARM (GBA), filesystem and other librarey functions
. you can compile this library with "gcc -c *.m" "gcc -shared libcarm.so *.o"
.
