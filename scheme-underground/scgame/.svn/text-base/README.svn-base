scgame is a drawing package a la Carbon.

It is based on Xlib for scsh and thus needs scx-0.2.
You can tune config.scm before you start.

Another homebrewed library for the linux framebuffer :

For another working putpixel method check out the scheme48-fb as a basis for
scsh images. You can get it at http://soft.vub.ac.be/~jceuppen/scheme/

fb stands for linux's framebuffer to draw on, the packages are named scheme48-*fb-*.

In the above scheme48-1.8-fb-x11 packages, X11 window drawing is
supported with xputpixel method.

Do read the packages' README and HACKING files if you run into any
problems.
