  "1. The following questions are intended to help you with the
configuration. The CSAN module needs a directory of its own to cache
important index files and maybe keep a temporary mirror of CSAN files.
This may be a site-wide or a personal directory.")

(define CSAN-shell-droptext-2
  "2. Unless you are accessing the CSAN on your filesystem via a file: URL,
CSAN.pm needs to keep the source files it downloads somewhere. Please
supply a directory where the downloaded files are to be kept.")

be saved in a separate 'o conf commit' command to make them permanent
between sessions. If you set the 'auto_commit' option to true, changes
to a config variable are always automatically committed to disk.")

directories with all the intermediate files.")

  "6. The CSAN indexes are usually rebuilt once or twice per hour, but the
typical CSAN mirror mirrors only once or twice per day. Depending on
the quality of your mirror and your desire to be on the bleeding edge,
you may want to set the following value to more or less than one day
(which is the default). It determines after how many days CSAN.pm
downloads new indexes.")

(define CSAN-shell-droptext-7
  "7. By default, each time the CSAN module is started, cache scanning is
performed to keep the cache size in sync. To prevent this, answer
'never'.")

  "8. To considerably speed up the initial CSAN shell startup, it is
possible to use Storable to create a cache of metadata. If Storable is
not available, the normal index mechanism will be used.

Note: this mechanism is not used when use_sqlite is on and SQLLite is
running.")

(define CSAN-shell-droptext-9
  "9. The CSAN module can detect when a module which you are trying to build
depends on prerequisites. If this happens, it can build the
prerequisites for you automatically ('follow'), ask you for
confirmation ('ask'), or just ignore them ('ignore'). Please set your
policy to one of the three values.")
