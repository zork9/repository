1. output goes to code.s file
2. input is moose.lisp file
3. examples are in the moose.lispX files
4. moose.config shows all implemented lisp syntax (do not edit though)

	4.1 asm ( <assemblycode> ) writes <assemblycode> clauses 
		directly to code.s
		(FIXME: There may not be a parens inside the assembler text)

5. run 'make' to compile and run 'neslisp' as above
